# Edsa Power Tracker

Community Power Tracker is a digital solution designed to crowdsource real-time electricity reliability data from communities in Sierra Leone and beyond.  
It connects **residents** and **electricity distributors** through a simple, transparent system that helps improve power delivery and decision-making.

## Overview

In many communities, power outages happen frequently — but there’s no system to track them in real time.  
Community Power Tracker solves this by allowing residents to report power availability through a **mobile app**, while distributors and administrators monitor live data through a **web dashboard**.

This project empowers communities and supports digital transformation by turning citizen input into actionable energy insights.
